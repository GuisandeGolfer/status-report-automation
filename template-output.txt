Escalation Avenues 

www.vmware.com/support/file-sr/escalation 

You can escalate a support request at any time either by speaking directly with the technician assigned or by requesting to speak with a Duty Manager/Regional Escalation Manager. 

We recommend that you contact VMware Support by telephone for escalations. This will ensure that your request is directed to the appropriate resources as soon as possible to achieve a successful resolution. 

The severity level of a support request can be increased without an escalation if the business impact of a support request has changed or was not correctly recorded initially
